                                    ASSIGNMENT-5
                                    ============

The assignment was very insightful and helped in understanding the OSPF protocol better.
I faced difficulties in managing the synchronization issues.
There was a confusion when to stop the routers, so it would have been more clear if it 
was also mentioned.
Else, everything went well.
