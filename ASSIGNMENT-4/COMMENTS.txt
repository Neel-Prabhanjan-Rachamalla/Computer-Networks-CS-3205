                                ASSIGNMENT-4
                                ============

The assignment was very insightful and helped in understanding the GO-BACK-N ARQ better.
I faced difficulties in managing the synchronization issues i.e. Sending packets and 
Receving Acks simultaneously.
However, the assignment would have been more clear if there was a sample input file so
that it would get us know exactly what is being expected from the assignment, else 
everything went well.
