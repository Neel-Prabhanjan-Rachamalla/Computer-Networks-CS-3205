1. Contents :- This folder contains Makefile,sourcefile,inputfile(to be included by code runner),commentsfile,scriptfile.

2. Running the file :- Typing the 'make' command will run the make file which will
                       indeed compile the file and create the 'lab2-cs20b056' executable
                       file.
                       This executable file can be run by command - ./lab2-cs20b056 5555 input.txt
                       where '5555' is the start port number. This port number can be any greater 
                       than 1024 which excludes the priviledged port numbers. And the input file
                       can be any .txt file having the same format as given in the example in moodle.
