                        CS-3205 ASSIGNMENT-2
                        ====================

This Assignment was indeed a very good implementation of the real DNS query system which
gave a true insight of what exactly happens in Iterative DNS Query System.

While doing the assignment , one of the problem I faced is while considering different
Ip Addresses for different servers which wasnt working for me. Then , I came to know that
running a server on remote machine can be done by a system call such as "system("ssh 10.6.15.92 Lab2/rds startportnum inputfile")".
However , I didnt implement it , I used 'localhost' for all the servers.

Overall , everything went fine with the assignment !
